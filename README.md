# py-asm
Assembly on Python, the weirdest combo of all time!

# What file does what?
- codes.txt is a text file describing functions which are present in current build
- code.pyasm is a test code
- compiler.py is main file
## How
Write code in `code.pyasm` and start `compiler.py` to see results<br>
All errors can be caused by your code or my code, so double-check `.pyasm` code before filling issues
